    "# Project 2: Practice with a Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "Some problems are complex and solving them one point at a time is wasteful. Instead the approach of randomly evaluating a point can lead to overall trends as the number of random evaluations becomes large. This is a time efficient method. We will examine a calculation using a Monte Carlo approach."

Assume the following: (1) the rod is rigid, non-extensible and its weight is negligible. (2) There is no friction and (3) The pendulum moves in a vertical plane under the gravitational field. When the oscillations are small, the period of the pendulum becomes\n",
